## 3.2 Provision Master Compute

1. Go to Compute -> Instance

![enter image description here](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/img/compute_1.JPG)

2. Click on "Create Instance"

3. Select the name as "soak8master" under "root" compartment

![enter image description here](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/img/compute_2.JPG)

4. Select the shape as "2.4". Select "Create a new virtual Network". Name the vcn as "soak8vcn" under "root" compartment. Name the subnet as "soak8subnet". And "assign a public ip"

![enter image description here](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/img/compute_3.JPG)

5. **PLEASE CLICK ON "Save private key" and "Save public key".** Save your private key name as "private.ppk" and save your public key as "public.pub". You need these key to login to the compute as well as later steps.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/img/compute_4.JPG)

6. Click on "compute" and jot down the public ip of your master node in labinfo.txt

![enter image description here](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/img/compute5.jpg)

## 3.3 Provision Worker Compute

1. Do the same steps as step 3.2. 

2. Instead of naming as soak8master, name it as "soak8worker"

3. instead of creating a new vcn and subnet, reused the same subnet and vcn created earlier.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/img/compute6.JPG)

4. Instead of creating a new private and public key. use back the key you have created previously. Drag and drop your "public.pub" into the public key.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/img/database3.JPG)

5. Name the host name as "soadb". Jot down the "Host domain name" in labinfo.txt. Choose the subnet and vcn that was used in the compute earlier.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/img/database5.JPG)


6. Name the below. Please follow.
> Database name: soadb

> Pdb: pdb1

>Password: WelcomE1234##

![enter image description here](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/img/datbase4.JPG)

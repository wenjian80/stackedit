# Purpose
1. The purpose of this lab excerise is to minc the same environment setup on premise.
2. We are using an external database as the soa repository.
3. We are installing k8 from scratch. In this lab however we are not creating a HA for master node. We can refer to K8 documentation on how to set it up.
4. For lab purpose we are using 1 master and 1 worker. Deployment are done in worker node as master are not tainted to run workload.
5. Since soa on k8 require a PV/PVC, in on prem context it will either a NFS or san storage etc. In this lab we are using Oracle Cloud File System to act as the NFS.


# 1. Prereq
1. Please follow the prereq to set your environment ready.  Follow the instruction on [prereq](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/tutorial/prereq.md)

2. You should already have your labinfo.txt fill up on hand. We will be referencing those info in these exercise.

TODO to explain steps

1. Excercise are running as root for lab purpose. Login to as opc, sudo su.
2. Clone this git project.
3. Create a folder call soak8_lab in both master and worker node in path /home/opc/
4. Winscp and copy the scripts folder into /home/opc/soak8_lab/scripts
5. sudo su 
6. chmod -R 777 /home/opc/soak8_lab


## Step 0: 0_InitialMachine_Config.sh
**[Run on master and worker node]**

1. This script need to run on both master and worker node.
2. We are setting up the yum repository in this script So the installation will make use the of the yum repository.

## Step 1: 1_Docker_Config.sh
**[Run on master and worker node]**

1. This script need to run on both master and worker node.

## Step 2: 2_KubeMaster_Firewall_Config.sh
**[Run on master node ONLY]**

1. **This script run on on master node ONLY.**
2. Kuberenetes require certain pre-req and firewall to communcation between master and worker nodes.  Refer to [K8 documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/) for more details.
3. We are disabling the firewall on linux for lab purpose.

## Step 3: 3_KubeNode_Firewall_Config.sh
**[Run on worker node ONLY]**

1. **This script run on on worker node ONLY.**
2. Same as step 2. We are setting the pre-req for k8.

## Step 4: 4_KubeMaster_Kubernetes_Config.sh
**[Run on master node ONLY]**

 1. **This script run on on master node ONLY.** Once the prereq has been set. 

 2. We are running the steps to set up this node as the master
    node. 
    
 3. At the end of this script it will provide you a command for
    worker node to join the cluster and communicate to this master node.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/img/master_ready.JPG)

4. **You will need to copy the last output of the kubeadm join on step 5 for the worker node to join the cluster**

5. Run the below command to check if master is ready. Wait until it is ready before proceed step 5.

```
kubectl get no
```

3. You need to change the subnet dns naming that you have jotdown in your labinfo.txt
```
PDB1.**subnet11251534.vcn11251534.oraclevcn.com[CHANGEIT]**
```
4. You can use the below command to change or open up and edit it

```
sed -i 's/VCNCHANGE/aaa.aaa.com.com/g'10_Rcu.sh
```
### **Script output**
The output of the script will be as such. It will take around 3-5min.

### **Change the NFS ip**
1. Open up [12_Mount_File.sh](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/scripts/12_Mount_File.sh) and replace the [INPUT_ID].
2. Open up your labinfo,txt, input the nfs ip into here.

```
    #PUT FILE SYSTEM IP HERE
    #Eg sudo mount 10.0.0.5:/soashared /soashared
    sudo mount [INPUT_ID]:/soashared /soashared
```
3. You can run the below to change the ip or open up to edit it.

```
sed -i 's/IPCHANGE/[YOURIP]/g' 12_Mount_File.sh
Eg  sed -i 's/IPCHANGE/10.0.0.1/g' 12_Mount_File.sh
```
## Step 13: 13_Soa_pv.sh
**[Run on master node ONLY]**

1. **This script run on on master node ONLY.**
2. **You need to make change to the below before running the script**
3. The script is using create-pv-pvc.sh to generate the yaml to create the pv and pvc.

### **Change the NFS ip**
1. Open up [create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml](https://github.com/wenjian80/soak8_labs/blob/main/scripts/create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml) and look for weblogicDomainStorageNFSServer to change the ip. You need to open up your labinfo.txt and replace the ip for your nfs ip.

```
weblogicDomainStorageNFSServer: [CHANGEIT]
```
2. You can run the below to change the ip or open up to edit it.

```
sed -i 's/IPCHANGE/[YOURIP]/g' create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml
Eg  sed -i 's/IPCHANGE/10.0.0.1/g' create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml
```
### **Check output**
1. Afrter running the script run the below command to check 
```
kubectl get pv,pvc -n soans
```
